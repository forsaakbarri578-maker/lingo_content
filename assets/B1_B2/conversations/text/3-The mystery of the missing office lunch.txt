A: I cannot believe it. It is gone. My lasagna has vanished from the fridge.
B: Are you sure you put it there this morning? Maybe you left it on the kitchen counter at home.
A: I am positive. I even wrote my name on the container with a giant red marker.
B: That is bold. Usually, a name tag is enough to stop a food thief.
A: Not in this office. This is the third time this month. Last week, my yogurt disappeared too.
B: Well, I saw Steve from accounting walking out of the breakroom with a very satisfied look on his face.
A: Steve? But he always brings a salad. He says he is on a strict diet.
B: Maybe his diet includes stealing other people's delicious homemade pasta.
A: I am going to confront him. Nobody touches my mother's secret recipe lasagna and gets away with it.
B: Wait, look! There is a red stain on your white shirt. Right near the collar.
A: What? Oh no. Don't tell me.
B: Did you eat it during the early morning meeting because you were bored?
A: I... I might have had a few bites while checking my emails. I completely forgot.
B: Case closed. You are the lasagna thief. You should apologize to Steve for your dark thoughts.
A: I feel like a fool. I guess I need to buy lunch for everyone now to make up for my drama.
