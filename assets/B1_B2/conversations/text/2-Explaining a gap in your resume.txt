A: I have reviewed your CV, Mr. Anderson. Your experience in sales is quite strong.
B: Thank you. I like to think I could sell ice to a polar bear.
A: However, I noticed a gap here. From 2022 to 2023, there is no employment listed.
B: Ah, yes. That was my "sabbatical" year.
A: I see. Did you travel the world? Did you volunteer in a remote village?
B: Not exactly. I decided to pursue a career as a professional gamer.
A: A video game player? For a whole year?
B: Yes. I thought I had a hidden talent. It turns out, my only talent is losing quickly.
A: That is... unexpected. How do you explain this gap to potential employers?
B: I usually say I was working on a "personal startup project" that failed due to market conditions.
A: Technically, that is true if the "market" was teenage competitors who were much faster than you.
B: Exactly. But I learned a lot about patience, strategy, and handling defeat.
A: Those are actually good skills for sales. You deal with rejection every day here.
B: See? It was professional training after all. Plus, I am now very eager to earn a real salary again.
A: I bet you are. Well, I appreciate your honesty. Most candidates just lie.
