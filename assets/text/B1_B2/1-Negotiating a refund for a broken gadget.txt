A: Excuse me, I would like to return this "Future Watch 3000". I bought it yesterday.
B: Oh, that is our best-selling model. What is the problem? Is the strap too tight?
A: No, the strap is fine. The problem is that the watch thinks I am dead.
B: I beg your pardon?
A: The heart rate monitor says zero. According to this watch, I have no pulse.
B: Let me see. Maybe you are wearing it wrong.
A: I am wearing it on my wrist, exactly like the manual said. Also, the battery died after two hours.
B: Well, high-tech features use a lot of power. Did you charge it fully?
A: Yes, for six hours. Look, I am not happy with it. I want a full refund.
B: Do you have the receipt and the original box?
A: I have the receipt right here. The box is in my car.
B: Okay. I see a small scratch on the screen. I cannot give you a full refund if the item is damaged.
A: That is not a scratch! It is a smudge. Look, I wiped it off with my sleeve. It is perfect.
B: Hmm, you are right. But our policy states that for electronics, we usually offer store credit or an exchange.
A: I do not want another watch that tells me I am a ghost. I want my money back on my credit card.
B: Sir, please lower your voice. There are other customers.
A: Then please process my refund. Otherwise, I will have to speak to your manager.
B: That won't be necessary. Since it is clearly defective, I will make an exception this time. Please insert your card.
A: Thank you. I appreciate your help.
